ID Software is responsible for a lot of classic games. Commander Keen, Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, and Quake come to mind.

Wolfenstein 3D is especially important to this particular post, as you may gather, based on the title. You're a prisoner-of-war in Nazi Germany. You end up fighting Hitler and stuff, 'tis pretty cool.

As Wolf3D was beginning development, their previous series, Commander Keen, was wrapping up. In episode 5, they slipped a little reference to their next game in:

</p>

You can see, made out of pipes, a swastika at the top-right of the screenshot. (And developer John Romero's name at the bottom-right. Sneaky.)

Neat little nod to their next project, right? Uh, well, sure, but think of it this way: nobody actually knew about Wolf3D yet. So when players saw it, they either thought "oh, that's an innocent coincidence", or "SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES, THE DEVELOPERS ARE NAZI SYMPATHISERS, AAA". Nonetheless, it made it into the game, and nobody really noticed.

After Wolf3D came Doom. In level 4 of the first episode, yet again, they referenced their prior game by placing a swastika in the level design. And this time, people did notice. Because it's Doom. And everyone played Doom. And people complained, this time.

In particular: an actual World War II veteran! So in version 1.4 of Doom, the swastika was changed to some arbitrary shape.

One interesting tidbit, here. John Romero was asked if he ever removed the swastika in Commander Keen 5. He replied that they did not remove the symbol.

...but someone certainly did at some point; at around the same time it was changed in Doom, that same set of pipes in subsequent copies of Commander Keen 5 now looked like this:

</p>

Also of note, but not enough to make me bother grabbing screenshots: the SNES version of Wolfenstein 3D removed all swastikas and... Hitler's moustache. And then they called him "Staatmeister". As if it wasn't obviously Hitler without the 'stache. Uh-huh.

That's about it, really! Shorter post, but any small revisional videogame edits like this interest me, for some reason. I'll be sure to write about more of them in the future!
